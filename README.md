#Jamie Patel

I am a recent University of Cambridge graduate in English, drawn to code for its blend of creativity and logical problem solving. I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com), a 12-week coding bootcamp in London, and am now looking for a job in a great company where I can continue to improve my skills as a developer.

##Code examples

As an example of its use, I built an app called [Last Train](https://github.com/jpatel531/last-train), where users can search for last train times and receive directions via SMS. | A Rails Instagram clone that incorporates, among other technologies, Websockets, Stripe, Amazon S3, ActionMailer and Google Maps.  | An AngularJS on Node app where the user can retrieve numerical and graphical data from their GitHub username. An exercise in using Karma, Protractor, Yeoman and D3.js |
